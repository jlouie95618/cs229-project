* HRR = Hospital referral regions
    - regional market areas for tertiary medical care. Each HRR contains at least ONE hospital that performs major cardiovascular procedures and neurosurgery.

* HSA = Hospital service areas
    - local healthcare markets for hospital care. An HSA is a collection of ZIP codes whose residents receive most of their hospitalizations from the hospitals in that area
    - offers great regional granularity than HRR

* Part A = Medicare's hospital insurance program
    - covers inpatient care in hospitals, nursing homes, etc.

* Part B
    - The coverage provided by Medicare Part B includes medically necessary doctor's services, outpatient care, and other services that Part A does not cover. Part B also covers preventive services.
